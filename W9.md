## Explicit Intent
- Intent
<br/> An intent is a msg objct that makes a request to the Androidd runtime system 
    - To start another specific activity (an Explicit Intent), or
    - start some other general component in the phone e.g. a map app (an implicit intent)
    - Pass data between components
    <br/>
    
- When there is NO Data to be passed
<br/> a explicit intent is typically written into 
```
Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, SubActivity.class);
startActivity(intent);
```
> The  ```MainActivity.this``` indicates the context within the MainActivity file
<br/>

## Universal Resource Indicators(URI)
URI refers to a string of characters used to idenify a resource.<br/>
Absolute URIs specify a scheme<br/>
For Example:<br/>
    - A document on the internetL http://www.google.com <br/>
    - A file on the computer: file:/Users/may/111111111 <br/>
    - An email address: meihui_fu@mymail.sutd.edu.sg<br/>
<br/>

**Hierarchical URIs**:have a slash character after the echeme ans can be parsed as follows:[scheme:][authority][path][?query][#fragment//]<br/>
**Opaque URIs**: do not have a slash characters and can be parsed as follows: [scheme:][opaque part][? Query]<br/>
For Example, to show a location in a maps app on your phone, you have to:<br/>
    - Specify the **_geo URI_** correctly <br/>
    - Execute an **_Implicit Intent_**

Construct a URI
define a builder class for URI

## Unit Testing
unit tester: breaking the program into smaller sections for the testing<br/>
What is the smallest unit in the unit testing?: usually a method , can also be a public class<br/>
Modular programming<br/>
**Separate the parts of the code that involve the UI and those that do not**
**JUnit4**: a commonly-used open-source framework to conduct unit testing <br/>
To conduct a test: write the test inside a _test class_ <br/>

>Why do we still need to perform testing since Java comes up with a compiler that tries to detect all kinds of anomalies during run-time<br/>
>Some funtionality/ effectiveness issue cannot be detected
<br/>
Example
```
public void addition_is_Correct(){assertEquals(//expected://4, //actual://2+2)}

```
**Static Checking + Testing**: Implying static testing tools while at the same time write tests. 
<br/>



Android Fragment
A view whoes layout can be changed dynamically<br/>
for UI design 


### The protected keyword
used for mattributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible in the same package and subclasses<br/>
A protected class: can be accessed by any class in the same package and subcalsses even in different packages.
